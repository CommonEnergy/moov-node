Every Moov account automatically comes with a Moov wallet, which serves as a funding source as you accumulate funds. 
At this time, wallets can't be manually created, deleted or modified. They are read-only and are automatically created when a Moov account is associated with an application. For more context, read our [wallets](/guides/sources/wallets/) guide.
